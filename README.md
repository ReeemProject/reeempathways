# REEEMpathways

Stakeholder engagement in the project builds largely on enabling tools and WP7 has the function of disseminating the insights gained from the project, and to get feedback from stakeholders to improve the models and other material being developed in the project.

To reach this objective an article-based open access online tool, REEEMpathways, has been developed to visualise the results/key messages derived from the integrated impact assessment modelling framework presented in Section 3 and enable stakeholder feedback and interaction.

The tool is populated by data stored in the REEEM Pathways Database and provides public access to modelling insights, input data and pathway assumptions from the project.

The user interface is designed with an emphasis on organising and showing model data on charts. A number of developed features enhance usability and accessibility. Among these, the possibility of downloading the data underlying the charts.

The tool enables REEEM partners to publish and update their own articles providing multiple types of static and dynamic charts to choose from to visualise their own key messages and the data behind it.
 
Following the concept of the REEEM project, this allows policy makers and stakeholders to explore and compare possible decarbonisation pathways. This may assist in understanding the effects of and requirements for energy system changes.

The tool has been integrated with social media (Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn) and this enables the public to discuss the results/key messages with REEEM partners and allows other modellers to contribute with their knowledge.
