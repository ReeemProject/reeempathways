The REEEM pathways describe three alternative energy system decarbonisation futures. They were designed in the early phases of the project (and subsequently revised) to provide a basis for:

•	Investigating key challenges related to the deep decarbonisation of the EU energy system outlined in the Energy Union package and the Clean Planet for all strategy, with a focus on the role and impact of technologies;
•	Coordinating the analyses carried out by the modelling groups within the REEEM Consortium on different sectors and scales;
•	Allowing stakeholders to provide inputs on the key issues of the decarbonisation.

In line with these objectives, the REEEM pathways do not necessarily represent likely or unlikely futures, nor any best – middle of the road – worst cases, nor any specific sets of policy decisions. Rather they attempt to analyse the effects of potential main dynamics which could occur in a deep decarbonisation transition, namely: 

•	The decarbonisation effort is mostly undertaken by decarbonisation of the energy supply (mainly decentralised);
•	Consumers take on an active role in the decarbonisation;
•	Ambitions are raised and all sectors of the economy must act together to achieve the targets. 

The following sub-sections describe why the above three themes were chosen and how the pathways were conceived and designed.
