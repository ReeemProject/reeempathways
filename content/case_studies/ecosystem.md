Focused on Lithuania. It assessed impacts of alternative forest management strategies on multiple ecosystem
services (i.e. industrial wood, bioenergy, carbon storage, recreation and habitat). The case study also
developed and discussed linking between an ecosystem service assessment tool (i.e. LEcA tool) and an energy
systems model (i.e. MESSAGE) in order to integrate ecosystem services in sustainability assessment of energy
policy and related forest bioenergy options.

**Message: Forest management strategies could ensure desired level of ecosystem services while supporting
fulfilment of national decarbonisation targets**

Substantial focus should be given to developing management strategies that keep the desired level of
ecosystem services while supporting fulfilment of national decarbonisation targets. The same level of
biomass supply can often be obtained using a multitude of different forest management configurations, both
with regards to the character of activities and their geographic allocation. Error! Reference source not found.
illustrates that when increasing the yields above a certain threshold, the resources may be exhausted in the
long run. At the same time, ecosystem services such as carbon storage, recreation and habitat supporting
biodiversity may also be affected. Forest management strategy is a crucial linkage between forest biomass
extraction and other ecosystem services. This could be particularly useful, as the energy systems optimisation
in REEEM suggests that a significant share of biomass will be included in the energy mix. Thus, before
allocating resources for bioenergy, judicious planning is critical in order to ensure the well-being of other
services.
