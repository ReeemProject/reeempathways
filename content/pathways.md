While the development of the REEEM integrated analysis framework and resulting insights are the key novel contributions of this research, another key component has been the scenario pathway design. This section describes the objectives and steps of the process and the resulting REEEM pathways.

This section builds on the earlier [deliverable D1.1 â€“ Report on pathway definition](http://www.reeem.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/REEEM-D1.1.pdf), which set out the methodology and the key aspects of the pathway design process in the early phases of the project. This has been revisited here in light of further development of the process
